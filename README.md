# internsavy_t2
This is the second task (out of 3) from the Internsavy.
Where I have wrote script (automised script) that clusters from the given dataset the data into clusters and visualises it

K-means technique was used for clustering. I have wrote script that can find the optimum amount of clusters, so script can identify by itself how will it work and to prove it there will be demonstated 4 graphs for the whole time.
